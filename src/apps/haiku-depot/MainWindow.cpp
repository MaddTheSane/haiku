		"people who like to tinker with their music. It facilitates rapid, "
		"dynamic, and radical processing of your performance.",
		"2.1.0 - 04 August 2002.\n\n"
		" * Important fix to file IO that prevents data corruption.\n\n"
		" * Dissolve filter could cause crash when operating on notes "
		"with extremely short durations. (thanks to David Shipman)\n\n"
		" * New tool bar ARP Curves (select Tool Bars->Show->ARP Curves "
		"in a track window) contains new tools for shaping events. Each "
		"tool is documented in the Tool Guide, but in general they are "
		"used to shape control change, pitch bend, tempo and velocity "
		"events (and notes if you're feeling creative), and the curve "
		"can be altered by pressing the 'z' and 'x' keys.\n\n"
		"All curve tools make use of a new tool seed for drawing "
		"bezier curves; see section 6.3.2. of the user's guide for an "
		"explanation of the Curve seed.\n\n"
		" * New menu items in the Song window: Edit->Expand Marked Range "
		"and Edit->Contract Marked Range. These items are only active if "
		"the loop markers are on. The Expand command shifts everything "
		"from the left marker to the end of the song over by the total "
		"loop range. The Contract command deletes the area within the "
		"loop markers, then shifts everything after the right marker "
		"left by the total loop range. If no tracks are selected, the "
		"entire song is shifted. Otherwise, only the selected tracks are "
		"affected.\n\n"
		" * System exclusive commands can now be added to devices. There "
		"is no user interface for doing so, although developer tools are "
		"provided here. Currently, the E-mu Proteus 2000 and E-mu EOS "
		"devices include sysex commands for controlling the FX.\n\n"
		" * A new page has been added to the Preferences window, Views. "
		"This page lets you set the height for the various views in "
		"Sequitur, such as pitch bend, control change, etc.\n\n"
		" * Multiple instances of the same MIDI device are given unique "
		"names. For example, two instances of SynC Modular will be "
		"named \"SynC Modular 1\" and \"SynC Modular 2\" so they can be "
		"accessed independently. (thanks to David Shipman)\n\n"
		" * In the track window, holding down the CTRL key now accesses "
		"an alternate set of active tools. (Assign these tools by "
		"holding down the CTRL key and clicking on the desired tool)\n\n"
		" * Right mouse button can now be mapped to any tool. (thanks "
		"to David Shipman)\n\n"
		" * The Vaccine.P and Vaccine.V filters have been deprecated "
		"(although they are still available here). They are replaced by "
		"the Vaccine filter. In addition to injecting a motion into the "
		"pitch and velocity of notes, this new filter can inject it "
		"into control change, pitch bend, tempo change and channel "
		"pressure events. The new tool Broken Down Line uses this "
		"filter.\n\n"
		" * Note to filter developers: The filter API has changed. You "
		"will need to recompile your filters.");
